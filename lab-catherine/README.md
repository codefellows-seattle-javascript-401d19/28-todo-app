## Lab 28 & 29: Todo List

### Author:

### Motivation

In this project, I built a frontend Todo List application containing a Home Page with a brief description about the application, and a Dashboard page where users can create their own Todo List. To create a Todo List, users can enter a note title and description and click `Create`. Users can edit any note by clicking the corresponding `Edit` button. This will take the user to a modal editing view where users can make edits to their notes. If a user would like to save the edit, they may click the `Update` button. If the user does not want to save their edit, they can click the `close` button, which will take the user back to their Dashboard. Users also have the ability to remove any of their created notes by clicking the `Delete` button next to the note they would like to remove. 

In this application, I configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. I was able to create and render React components to the DOM, add event listeners to React components, and update React component state.

This application uses localStorage for persistence!
