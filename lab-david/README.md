## Notes + React
This is a note list saver thing built on ReactJS. 

## Motivation
I want to build beautiful things (this one doesn't count as a beautiful thing).

## Description
This app lets you create and save notes for a browser window session. 

## Tech Used
React, Babel, Webpack, SASS

## Components:
- NoteForm : this allows a user to complete a note
- NoteList : this tracks all the notes made
- NoteItem : this is for each item
- App : this controls the application
- Dashboard : This controls the routing for the routes.
- Landing : this is the main landing page.
- Modal : this is a pop up that initiates when a user clicks to edit a note. 

## Tests
### Dashboard
A test runs to make sure the dashboard has initial state.

### Note Form
A test runs to make sure the note form has initial state.
