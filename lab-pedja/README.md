## Feature Tasks 
create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram.  
``` 
App
  Landing
  Dashboard
    NoteForm
    NoteList
      Noteitem
```
#### App

* The state should contain a notes array
* It should have a bound `addNote(note)` method that adds a note to `state.notes`
  * each note that is added should have the following data
    * `id`: always should contain the result of `uuid.v1()`
    * `editing`: false by default
    * `completed`: false by default
    * `content`: user provided content
    * `title`: user provided title
* It should have a bound `removeNote(note)` method that removes a note from `state.notes` based on its `id`

#### NoteForm Component
* `onComplete` the NoteForm should add a note to the application state

#### NoteList Component 
* should display an unordered list of NoteItem components

#### NoteItem
* should display the notes content and title
* should display a delete button
  * `onClick` the note should be removed from the application state

## Test
* Test Dashboard
  * Test the initial state
* Test NoteForm
  * Test the initial state

##  Documentation  
Write a description of the project in your README.md
